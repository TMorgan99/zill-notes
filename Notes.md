That's a great start, but the page lists 154 results, and your JSON only shows me 5 of them.  Is there a way to get the rest ?

Here are a few ways you could get the full list:
1.	Scroll through the entire page: Let all listings load, then ask me again — I’ll be able to extract more.
OK, I've scrolled to the end of the first page. Let's try again.
